Hi Ronny,

The more I learn about Rise, the more excited I am about the opportunity to start a discussion on a senior marketing position. Since Rise is a tech-forward company, I forwent the typical PDF and instead added a résumé to a personal site ([ryanwatters.io/resume](https://ryanwatters.io/resume)) I started developing a couple months ago.

As you know, my first love is writing, but my experience as a web writer and publisher have lent themselves to the more technical components of the web over the last few years. My ideal next position will take full advantage of both my love of storytelling and my boundless fascination with web technology, data, analytics, and automation.

At the risk of being brazen, I've taken to reading all the content on riseinteractive.com and am currently putting together a brief and informal audit. Of course, I'm not privy to crucial information; i.e., the site's core strategy, content models, content marketing framework (e.g., CMI), preferred style, analytics, etc. I also know the site is only a recent project for the agency and that Rise is a hotbed of SEO expertise, but I think I have a lot to offer to the site's continual improvement. Once complete, I'll email you the audit along with the disclaimer that the claims are not criticisms; rather, the audit illustrates the way I approach projects of this ilk as a content strategist and web professional.

Please send Lisa my best, and I hope you're enjoying your time overseas.

Look forward to talking with you soon,

Ryan
