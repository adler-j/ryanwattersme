Every content management system has its idiosyncrasies, but concepts borrowed from object-oriented programming (eg, inheritance, object properties and prototypes), structured data (eg, XML or HTML), and dynamically generated content (eg, templating filters, DBMS, CMS relationships) lend themselves exceptionally well to repurposing content, publishing on the web, and maintaining the integrity of intellectual property.<p><a href="http://www.ryanwatters.me">Ryanwatters.me</a> is an exercise in building a website with an empty CMS. <a href="https://ryansportfol.io">Ryansportfol.io</a> is the home of my future portfolio site.

When I first joined the PREP team, all document management and editorial process was non-standardized, manual, email-based, time intensive, and prone to error. Through the following business case, I was able to shift an outmoded system to a proper DMS and standardized editorial process. Through the shift to SharePoint, my direct report (Medical Copy Editor) and I were able to reduce TTP from 3 weeks to just 2 days.<p>The second project, a request site built on the AAP’s intranet (known internally as “websites” because of the “aap.org/websites” vanity URL), was also developed in response to an outmoded system—email-based requests from content owners and a lack of codified editorial process for new and existing content on <a href="https://www.aap.org">AAP.org</a>.<h3>PREP SharePoint Business Proposal</h3><ul><li>Reduced post–peer review TTP from 3 weeks to 2 days<li>Wireframes developed using <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle">Omnigraffle</a> SharePoint templates<li>Excel-based, auto-generated production schedules that only required product managers enter in a single peer review date<li>Potential savings calculator<li>Critical success factors, perceived challenges, provisions and further discussion<li>Competitive analysis with other DMS tools (ie, ScholarOne)<li>High- and low-level process maps (<a href="/samples/docs/prep_process.pdf">process section of proposal</a>) developed in Microsoft Visio</ul><h3>AAP.org/websites Request System</h3><p>The following is a screen shot of the home page aap.org/websites.
