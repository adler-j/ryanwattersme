## Strategy

The following is a mix of different pieces I have developed for editorial and content strategy over the last few years.

* [**Content Audit:**](/samples/docs/content_audit.xlsx) I developed a content audit ([PDF](/samples/docs/content_audit.pdf) or [Excel workbook](/samples/docs/content_audit.xlsx)) as part of the standard migration process ([see the migration tutorial site sample](/samples/aapmigrations/process1/)). A more detailed explanation of the audit's components can be found on the first tab of the Excel workbook. 
* [**Core Modeling Exercise:**](/samples/docs/core_modeling.pdf) The core modeling exercise ([PDF](/samples/docs/core_modeling.pdf)) helps content owners actively participate in strategy development for new sites or migrations of old content to a new platform. The exercise forces stakeholders to delimit business objectives, user tasks, audience hierarchy, and forward and inward paths before making less fundamental decisions about a site (eg, site architecture or visual design) that will unequivocally suffer if the core model is not already well delimited.
