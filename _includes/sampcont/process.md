## Process Improvements

The following two samples are projects I spearheaded while working for the American Academy of Pediatrics. 

I began the first draft of the SharePoint business proposal ([download proposal (PDF)](/samples/docs/prep_sp_proposal.pdf)) almost 3 years ago in an effort to reduce post&ndash;peer review time to publish (TTP) for the PREP (Pediatric Review and Education Program) line of subspecialty and generalist products for pediatricians. When I first joined the PREP team, all document management and editorial process was non-standardized, manual, email-based, time intensive, and prone to error. Through the following business case, I was able to shift an outmoded system to a proper DMS and standardized editorial process. Through the shift to SharePoint, my direct report (Medical Copy Editor) and I were able to reduce TTP from 3 weeks to just 2 days.

The second project, a request site built on the AAP's intranet (vanity URL of aap.org/websites), was also in response to an outmoded system&mdash;email-based requests from content owners and a lack of codified editorial process for new and existing content on [AAP.org](https://www.aap.org).

### PREP SharePoint Business Proposal  

* Reduced post&ndash;peer review TTP from 3 weeks to 2 days
* Wireframes developed using [Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) SharePoint templates
* Excel-based, auto-generated production schedules that only required product managers enter in a single peer review date
* Potential savings calculator
* Critical success factors, perceived challenges, provisions and further discussion
* Competitive analysis with other DMS tools (ie, ScholarOne)
* High- and low-level process maps ([download process portion of the proposal (PDF)](/samples/docs/prep_process.pdf)) developed in Microsoft Visio
* Screenshots


### AAP.org/websites Request System

* Automated workflow using SharePoint 2013, Access web apps, SharePoint Designer 2013, and Visio Pro
