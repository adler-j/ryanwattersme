## Process Improvements

The following two samples are projects I spearheaded while working for the American Academy of Pediatrics. 

I began the first draft of the [SharePoint business proposal](/samples/docs/prep_sp_proposal.pdf) 3 years ago in an effort to reduce post-peer review time to publish (TTP) for the Pediatric Review and Education Program (PREP) line of subspecialty and generalist products for pediatricians. When I first joined the PREP team, all document management and editorial process was non-standardized, manual, email-based, time intensive, and prone to error. Through the following business case, I was able to shift an outmoded system to a proper DMS and standardized editorial process. Through the shift to SharePoint, my direct report (Medical Copy Editor) and I were able to reduce TTP from 3 weeks to just 2 days.

The second project, a request site built on the AAP's intranet (known internally as "websites" because of the "aap.org/websites" vanity URL), was also developed in response to an outmoded system&mdash;email-based requests from content owners and a lack of codified editorial process for new and existing content on [AAP.org](https://www.aap.org).

### PREP SharePoint Business Proposal  

* Reduced post&ndash;peer review TTP from 3 weeks to 2 days
* Wireframes developed using [Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) SharePoint templates
* Excel-based, auto-generated production schedules that only required product managers enter in a single peer review date
* Potential savings calculator
* Critical success factors, perceived challenges, provisions and further discussion
* Competitive analysis with other DMS tools (ie, ScholarOne)
* High- and low-level process maps ([process section of proposal](/samples/docs/prep_process.pdf)) developed in Microsoft Visio

### AAP.org/websites Request System

The following is a screen shot of the home page aap.org/websites. The main menu icons on the top left show the high-level structure of the site collection.

* Automated workflow using SharePoint 2013, Access web apps, SharePoint Designer 2013, Visio Pro, and InfoPath services
* The first editorial process map for AAP.org content requests for content owners ([request process](/samples/docs/request_process.vsdx) \[Visio document\]) 
* Reporting capabilities (see screenshot); the site has processed thousands of requests and now average less than 2 days for request turnarounds
* Improved transparency&mdash;all content owners were able to see where their recent requests fell in the editorial process
* Separate video request form for [Ooyala](http://www.ooyala.com/), the AAP's new video digital asset management system
* Consolidated editorial calendars for AAP.org, the member-focused web property, and HealthyChildren.org, the parent-focused web property; this allowed the websites team to share our editorial calendars across the organization and allow for better forecasting of AAP.org homepage content
* Separate Google Analytics requests subsite for content owners to better monitor traffic to their site
* Open discussion boards for content owners to communicate with each other and directly with websites teams
* Drastically reduced inbox bloat and miscommunication between content owners and the websites team
* Housed dozens of individual team sites for content owners to work through their content migration from ColdFusion to SharePoint 2013 (for more on the migration process, please see the [reproduction of aapmigrations.org](/samples/aapmigrations/process1/) I have included in this samples collection)
