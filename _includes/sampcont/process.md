## Process Improvements

The following two samples are projects I spearheaded while working for the American Academy of Pediatrics. 

I began the first draft of the SharePoint business proposal ([download proposal (PDF)](/samples/docs/prep_sp_proposal.pdf)) almost 3 years ago in an effort to reduce post&ndash;peer review time to publish (TTP) for the PREP (Pediatric Review and Education Program) line of subspecialty and generalist products for pediatricians. When I first joined the PREP team, all document management and editorial process was non-standardized, manual, email-based, time intensive, and prone to error. Through the following business case, I was able to shift an outmoded system to a proper DMS and standardized editorial process. Through the shift to SharePoint, my direct report (Medical Copy Editor) and I were able to reduce TTP from 3 weeks to just 2 days.

The second project, a request site built on the AAP's intranet, was also in response to an outmoded system&mdashl;email-based requests from content owners and a lack of codified editorial process for [AAP.org](https://www.aap.org) and, more specifically, AAP.org subsite migrations.  

### Features of the PREP SharePoint Business Proposal
