## Content Migrations

Please visit the full version of the [AAP.org content migration site](/samples/aapmigrations/) (originally aapmigrations.info) included in this samples collection. I developed this site in mid 2014 to facilitate the migration of 50+ AAP.org subsites from our previous web platform (ColdFusion) to our new CMS (SharePoint 2013). I wanted to create an environment where my colleagues could learn about content management strategy, best practices for web writing, web technology basics, and editorial process. 

I wrote every line of content and code for the site. The newest version of the site now hosted internally and is therefore inaccessible to anyone outside of the organization's network.

### Site Features 

* A [tag search](/samples/aapmigrations/tagging/) containing the new metadata schema for AAP.org 
* A [front matter generator](/samples/aapmigrations/frontmattergenerator/) that extended the tag search and allowed content owners to access the same controlled vocabulary developed for the website
* Content standardization, including [naming conventions](/samples/aapmigrations/naming/); [PDF](/samples/aapmigrations/pdfs/), [image, and video](/samples/aapmigrations/multimedia/) optimizations; and a walkthrough of the new [submission processe](/samples/aapmigrations/submitnew/)
* An [introduction to web writing best practices](/samples/aapmigrations/writing101/)
* Step-by-step tutorials on [creating web pages](/samples/aapmigrations/createpage/), [metadata](/samples/aapmigrations/tagging/), and the website's first [standardized migrations process](/samples/aapmigrations/process1/)
