## Content Migrations

Please visit the full version of the [AAP.org content migration site](/samples/aapmigrations/) (originally aapmigrations.info) I have included in this samples collection. I developed this site in mid-2014 to facilitate the content migration of 50+ AAP.org subsites from our previous platform (ColdFusion) to our new CMS (SharePoint 2013). I wanted to provide an area where my colleagues could learn about content management strategy, best practices for web writing, web technology basics, and editorial process. 

I wrote every line of content and code for the site. The current site is now part of the organizations internal network and is therefore unavailable for feature in the samples collection.

### Site Features 

* A [tag search](/samples/aapmigrations/tagging/) contains the metadata schema I developed for AAP.org in an effort to tag new and legacy content for the site. 
* A [front matter generator](/samples/aapmigrations/frontmattergenerator/) that extends the tag search and allows content owners to access the same controlled vocabulary I developed for the websites team
* Content standardization, including [naming conventions](/samples/aapmigrations/naming/); [PDF](/samples/aapmigrations/pdfs/), [image, and video](/samples/aapmigrations/multimedia/) optimizations; and content [submissions processes](/samples/aapmigrations/submitnew/)
* An [introduction to web writing best practices](/samples/aapmigrations/writing101/)
* Tutorials on [creating web pages](/samples/aapmigrations/createpage/), [metadata](/samples/aapmigrations/tagging/), and the [standardized migrations process I developed as the Editor](/samples/aapmigrations/process1/)
