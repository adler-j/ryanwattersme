## Writing and Editing

Although I have more than 7 years experience as a professional writer and editor, this section of the samples collection is decidedly short. Rather than make samples freely available online and risk a conflict of interest, please contact me directly ([ryan@ryansportfol.io](mailto:ryan@ryansportfol.io)) for more examples of medical copy editing and medical writing. 

* [Farrell Valve System](/samples/docs/farrell_valve_system.pdf) I wrote this piece for [CORPAK MedSystems] in the summer of 2014. The piece demonstrates my ability to independently research complex content and translate it into accessible language. This piece was written in AMA 10 style.
* [LifeCell Educational Module](/samples/docs/lifecell_circulatory.pdf) This piece is one of a series of educational models I developed in conjunction with Agentive Marketing (New Jersey) in 2010 for LifeCell, a company that develops and sells tissue grafts and blood cell preservation products. This piece on the circulatory system was used by sales representatives. **Note:** the styling of this piece is very different from AMA 10 and was written to reflect the preferred style of the client. 
* **Style Guide** The following screenshot is of the style guide I'm developing for my current employer. The guide is composed of the following;
    - New metadata (site columns) for document management (eg, client ISIs, PIs, CVAs)
    - Consolidation of more than 20 PDF guides into an exceptions-only model for brand-specific styles
    - A separate document library with associated metadata for better reference management
    - A new House Style for promoting consistency and standards across all Precision products. **Note:** This style guide is currently used by only the Chicago office but will soon expand to offices in New Jersey, New York, California, and Connecticut
