## Writing and Editing

Although I have more than 7 years experience as a professional writer and editor, this section of the samples collection is decidedly short. Rather than make samples freely available online, I would prefer you to contact me directly ([ryan@ryansportfol.io](mailto:ryan@ryansportfol.io)) if you would like to see more examples of medical copy editing and writing.
