## [Tutorial Site](/samples/aapmigrations/)

I built [this site](/samples/aapmigrations/), which originally lived at http://aapmigrations.info, to facilitate the content migrations of 50+ AAP.org subsites from our previous platform (ColdFusion) to our new CMS (SharePoint 2013). I also wanted a single resource for my colleagues to learn about basic content management strategy, best writing practices, web technology, and editorial process. I wrote every line of content and code for the site.

### Site Features 

* A [tag search](/samples/aapmigrations/tagging/) contains the metadata schema I developed for AAP.org in an effort to tag new and legacy content for the site. 
* A [front matter generator](/samples/aapmigrations/frontmattergenerator/) that extends the tag search and allows content owners to access the same controlled vocabulary I developed for the websites team
* Content standardization, including [naming conventions](/samples/aapmigrations/naming/); [PDF](/samples/aapmigrations/pdfs/), [image, and video](/samples/aapmigrations/multimedia/) optimizations; and content [submissions processes](/samples/aapmigrations/submitnew/)
* An [introduction to web writing best practices](/samples/aapmigrations/writing101/)
* Tutorials on [creating web pages](/samples/aapmigrations/createpage/), [metadata](/samples/aapmigrations/tagging/), and the [standardized migrations process I developed as the Editor](/samples/aapmigrations/process1/)
