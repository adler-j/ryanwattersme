Content and coding for this site is currently in development and scheduled for publication on 2015/11/01. 

Once this site is completed, I'll be including a multi-step, open-source tutorial series on how I built the site using [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com), command line tools (including [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com), [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), and [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for testing.

Although content is still being created, I would like to extend a special thank you to [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for helping me during the testing phase of development.
