Content and coding for this site is currently in development and scheduled for publication on 2015/12/01.

{{jekyll.environment}} 

Once this site is completed, I'll be including a multi-step, open-source tutorial series on how I built the site using [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com), command line tools (including [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [Tipue](http://www.tipue.com/), and possibly [lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com)), [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), and [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for testing.

Although final content for site launch has yet to be published on the live site, I would like to extend a special thank you to [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for helping me during the testing phase of development. If you haven't used their product, it's the best option out there for all your cross-browser and cross-platform testing needs.
