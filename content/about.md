### The Site

#### Content

All content for the site is written in clean, semantic [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Extensions to the markdown are rendered on the client, but ultimately, everything I've written for this site is structured well enought to be ported to any [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/) that interprets `.md` files with embedded `yaml`.

#### Design

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Dicta harum recusandae laudantium nostrum praesentium asperiores doloremque itaque consectetur obcaecati eaque. Incidunt cupiditate quisquam harum qui, dolor? Vel officiis a necessitatibus?

#### Development

Every line of code used to develop this site is open source and [hosted in a public GitHub Repository](https://www.github.com/rdwatters/ryanwattersme).
