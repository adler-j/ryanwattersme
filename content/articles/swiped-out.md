Eight weeks ago, the day after she showed up at my apartment drunk enough to fall sleep with her shoes still on, I spoonfed an ICU nurse 7 years my junior the words she would need to break my heart.

You can quell that tinge of empathy; this is the first time anything like this has ever happened. In fact, this was the first time a woman had broken up with *me* since 1999. My previous record should preempt your feelings of sadness entirely.



In front of her was an empty plate. I wanted her to eat something before we talked, so I made some small, good things. Eggs. Cheese. Feeding her, I assumed, would make us both feel better.

When there was nothing left on the plate but the weight of the , I started speaking for her. My time is valuable, I told her. I told her guilt and self-loathing were tenuous tethers. I deserve someone with better motivations.

"Don't worry. I'll bounce back," I said.

"I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. You're a *really* great guy." [^1]

"You're off the hook," I said.

And she was.

And then I downloaded Tinder.
