### Me

My name is Ryan. I am a content strategist, editor, writer, and web publisher living Chicago, IL.

People have told me to write a blog for the last decade, but I didn't fall in love with the web until 2013. I'm trying to catch up.

### The Site

#### Content

All content for the site is written in clean, semantic [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) according to the latest [commonmark spec](http://spec.commonmark.org/). Extensions to the markdown are rendered on the client via [several JavaScript modules](https://github.com/rdwatters/ryanwattersme/tree/master/assets/js/modules). That said, my aim was to create CMS-independent content that could be easily ported to any [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/) that interprets markdown files with embedded yaml.

#### Design

This site uses two premium typefaces, Chaparral Pro and Futura PT, both of which are provided via [Adobe's Typekit web service](https://typekit.com/fonts).

#### Development

All code used for this site is open source and [hosted on GitHub](https://www.github.com/rdwatters/ryanwattersme).
