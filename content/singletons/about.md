### Me

My name is Ryan. I am a content strategist, editor, writer, and web publisher in Chicago, IL.

Friends have told me to write a blog for the last decade. I'm just catching up.

### The Site

#### Content

All content for the site is written in clean, semantic [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) in observation of the latest [commonmark spec][]. As a publisher, my intent is to create CMS-independent content that can be easily ported to any [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/) with support for markdown files with embedded yaml. Where markdown falls short, extensions to the syntax are rendered on the client through a handful of [JavaScript modules](https://github.com/rdwatters/ryanwattersme/tree/master/assets/js/modules) and [Hugo Shortcodes](http://gohugo.io/extras/shortcodes/).

#### Development

All code used for this site is open source and [hosted on GitHub](https://www.github.com/rdwatters/ryanwattersme).

There were many moving parts in the development of this site. Suffice it to say that I built this site [with performance][] and simplicity in mind.
